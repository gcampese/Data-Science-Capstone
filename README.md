# Yelp Data Exploration
My partner and I conduct an exploration on the complex Yelp Dataset in this project. We utilize Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), several machine learning models, and NLP in our analysis. This was presented in-person as our Data Science Capstone to a panel of George Washington University Data Science professors on December 5th, 2019 in Foggy Bottom.
